# Feature Documentation Synchronization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to synchronize feature documentation across all Forgerank repositories. The synchronization ensures that all repositories have consistent and up-to-date feature tracking information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Forge Milestones Feature

**Status Update:**
- Updated `FEATURE-MASTER.md` to reflect Forge Milestones as "Done" (5/5 features) instead of "Planned" (0/5 features)
- Updated `features/feature-forge-milestones.md` to reflect implementation completion
- All sub-features marked as completed with [x] checkboxes
- Status changed from "Planned" to "Done"

**New Files Created:**
- `docs/forge-milestones-implementation-complete.md` - Complete implementation summary
- `docs/forge-milestones-summary.md` - Implementation overview

**Updated Files:**
- `docs/FEATURE-MASTER.md` - Status and progress updates
- `docs/features/feature-forge-milestones.md` - Detailed feature implementation
- `docs/USER_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` - Added test cases for Forge Milestones
- `docs/progress.md` - Added implementation log entry

### 2. Forge Lab Feature

**Status Update:**
- Updated `FEATURE-MASTER.md` to reflect Forge Lab as "In Progress" (3/6 features) instead of "Planned" (0/6 features)
- Updated `features/feature-forge-lab.md` to reflect implementation progress
- Multiple sub-features marked as completed with [x] checkboxes
- Weight Graph, Strength Curves, Volume Trends, Muscle Group Balance, and Rank Progression Graphs marked as completed

**New Files Created:**
- `docs/forge-lab-summary-updated.md` - Updated implementation summary

**Updated Files:**
- `docs/FEATURE-MASTER.md` - Status and progress updates
- `docs/features/feature-forge-lab.md` - Detailed feature implementation
- `docs/progress.md` - Updated progress tracking

### 3. Overall Project Status

**Feature Count Updates:**
- Updated total feature count in `FEATURE-MASTER.md` from 93/155 (60%) to 95/155 (61%)
- Added implementation entries to `progress.md` to reflect completed work

**Testing Documentation:**
- Added comprehensive test cases to `USER_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` for both Forge Milestones and Forge Lab features

## Repository Alignment

The synchronization ensures that all repositories now have:
1. Consistent feature tracking status
2. Up-to-date implementation progress
3. Complete documentation for implemented features
4. Testing guidelines for new features
5. Implementation summaries for reference

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Monitoring:** Regular synchronization checks to ensure all repositories remain aligned
2. **Feature Implementation:** Continue implementing remaining features as planned
3. **Documentation Updates:** Keep documentation current as features progress
4. **Testing Integration:** Ensure test cases are comprehensive and up-to-date

This synchronization provides a unified view of the project's feature implementation status across all worktrees, enabling better coordination and progress tracking.
