## CULTURE (50)

1. The total is all that matters.
2. Squat, bench, dead. That's the holy trinity.
3. Depth is a lifestyle, not a suggestion.
4. White lights are the only validation you need.
5. The platform doesn't care about your feelings. Just your numbers.
6. Openers should be intimidating to others, not to you.
7. Your second attempt should be your planned max.
8. Thirds are for heroes and gamblers.
9. If you're not peaking, you're just training.
10. The grind is where champions are separated from everyone else.
11. RPE 10 means there was nothing left. Nothing.
12. Reps in reserve? Leave nothing in reserve on meet day.
13. The chalk talks to me. It says "grip harder."
14. Nose tork before maxes. It's tradition.
15. Commands are easy when your form is perfect.
16. "Down... Press... Rack" should be your lullaby.
17. Raw or equipped, the barbell doesn't discriminate.
18. Your belt is your armor. Tighten it.
19. The pause at the bottom is where you find yourself.
20. Hitching is for trailers, not deadlifts.
21. Sumo is not cheating. It's leverages.
22. Conventional is not better. It's preference.
23. The eccentric builds the concentric.
24. Speed work creates meet-day explosiveness.
25. Percentages are just suggestions until you're under the bar.
26. The gym total means nothing. The meet total is everything.
27. Bomb out once, shame on the meet. Bomb out twice, shame on you.
28. Every flight is a new opportunity.
29. You're only as strong as your weakest lift.
30. The deadlift is where meets are won and lost.
31. Squat walkout should be two steps. Maximum.
32. Bench arch isn't cheating. It's physics.
33. Grip width, stance width—find YOUR position.
34. The bar doesn't know it's heavy. Only you do.
35. Competition is you versus the barbell. Everyone else is background noise.
36. Training cycles are just chapters in your lifting story.
37. Deload weeks are not optional. They're strategic.
38. The platform is where you prove yourself.
39. Good mornings and missed squats look the same. Don't do either.
40. When the bar slows, you push HARDER.
41. Your body follows your head. Look where you want to go.
42. Attempt selection is an art form.
43. The deadlift bar whip can make or break a pull.
44. Calibrated plates are the only truth.
45. The nine attempts you get define your meet. Choose wisely.
46. Strong bench? Great. But can you squat?
47. The best lifters are the ones who show up consistently.
48. Records are meant to be broken. Especially yours.
49. One more kilo. One more pound. That's how totals grow.
50. The barbell humbles everyone eventually. Respect it.
