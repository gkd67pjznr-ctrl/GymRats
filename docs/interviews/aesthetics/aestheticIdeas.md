HOW TO COMBINE PURE’S AESTHETIC WITH LIFTOFF’S FUNCTIONALITY

(This is the important part)

You do not want to reskin Liftoff as Pure.
That would kill usability.

Instead, you layer Pure’s emotional language on top of Liftoff’s engine.

Think:
Pure = personality layer
Liftoff = mechanical layer

1. Where Pure SHOULD influence GymRats
A. Transitional moments (not core logging)

Use Pure’s vibe in:

Workout start

Workout end

PR moments

Rank-ups

Rest screens

Empty states

Example:

Instead of “Workout Complete”

“You showed up.”

Instead of “Rest 90s”

“Breathe. You earned this.”

This preserves speed where it matters.

B. Illustration as accent, not background

Small illustrated badges

Rank emblems with personality

Illustrated cue cards

Emotional micro-feedback

Not full psychedelic screens mid-set.

C. Language & copy

This is the biggest win.

Pure’s strength is tone, not visuals.

Examples:

“No disappearing acts” → “No skipping leg day”

“Anything but boring” → “Anything but half reps”

“Be honest with your intentions” → “Log it like you lifted it”

This costs zero performance and adds massive personality.

2. Where Liftoff MUST stay dominant

Set logging

Weight entry

Timers

Charts

History

Analytics

Leaderboards

These must remain:

Clean

Predictable

Fast

Boring (in the good way)
