## Key Principles Followed

1. **Only Updated Current Repository**: Made changes only to files in the current repository (Forgerank-qwen)
2. **No Deletions**: Preserved all existing content without removing any information
3. **Accumulated Information**: Added new information found in other repositories without going backwards
4. **Consistency**: Maintained consistent documentation style and structure
5. **Completeness**: Ensured all feature implementations are properly documented

## Verification

All updates have been verified to ensure:
- No existing information was deleted
- Only additive changes were made
- Documentation remains consistent and accurate
- All implemented features are properly tracked
- Testing documentation is comprehensive
- Project status reflects current development state

The current repository now has synchronized documentation that accurately reflects the feature implementation status across all worktrees while maintaining all existing information.
