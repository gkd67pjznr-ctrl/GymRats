## Vision & Culture (Key Quote)

> "What gets me is the app really coming into form and embodying gym culture. There's no lifting app that 'gets' lifting culture I don't think. It's all so safe and sterile and out of touch. So the app being good and being an embodiment of current and past gym culture, and that feel, that vibe, being the draw, the thing that gets people excited about the app. That it IS gym culture, and it connects them to other people who love gym culture in all its forms."

### Culture Direction
- **Heart:** Bodybuilding culture
- **Vibe:** Raw, real, not sterilized
- **Online culture:** Embraced (memes, influencer culture, terminally online humor)
- **Edginess:** Opt-in via buddy selection
- **Inclusivity:** Welcoming onboarding → authentic core experience

| Discord community | Will create |
