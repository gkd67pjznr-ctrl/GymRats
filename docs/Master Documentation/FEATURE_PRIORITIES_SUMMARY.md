## Critical Path Analysis

### Highest Priority (Blockers)
1. **AI Gym Buddy** - Core differentiator, needs 8-12 personalities
2. **Avatar System** - Emotional investment driver
3. **Social Feed** - Retention mechanism
4. **Onboarding** - First impression critical
5. **Performance** - Must hit 60fps targets

### High Risk Areas
1. **Avatar Growth System** - Multiple art styles + growth algorithm
2. **AI Voice Generation** - Quality for 8-12 characters
3. **Design Execution** - Pure-inspired aesthetic
4. **User Acquisition** - Competition with established apps

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with 2D avatar styles, add 3D later
- Launch with text-only buddies, add voice progressively
- Iterate on design with user feedback
- Focus on Workout Replay for organic sharing
