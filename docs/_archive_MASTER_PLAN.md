# VISION STATEMENT

**Forgerank is a workout tracking app that feels alive.**

It's not just a logging tool - it's a gym buddy with personality, a ranking system that matters, and a social experience that keeps you coming back. Where other apps feel sterile and transactional, Forgerank feels like it knows you, celebrates with you, and pushes you to be better.

# CORE DIFFERENTIATORS

## 1. Forgerank Scoring System
**What makes us different:** Static, verified standards.

- **0-1000 score, 20 ranks per exercise** (Iron to Mythic)
- **e1RM-based scoring** using Epley formula
- **Static top-end standards** based on verified, video'd world-class lifts
- **Key insight:** Users compare against REAL standards, not inflated user-submitted data
- **Anti-cheat philosophy:** Playful cues for anomalies ("DAAAAMN did you really do that??"), but ranks never inflate

**Why this wins:** Users know their rank means something. It's not gamified nonsense - it's real progress against real standards.

## 2. The Cue System (Gym Buddy)
**What makes us different:** The app has personality.

- **Customizable voices/personalities** - Users pick their gym buddy
- **3-5 personalities at launch**, more added regularly via AI (Arnold, influencers, "muscle mommy" archetypes)
- **Text + optional audio** - Let users choose their preference
- **Contextual encouragement** - Knows your state, says the right thing at the right time
- **Celebratory moments** - PRs, rank-ups, streaks all get personalized reactions

**Why this wins:** Every other app is a spreadsheet. We have a character.

## 3. The Aesthetic
**What makes us different:** Looks so good people want to show it off.

**Inspired by:** Pure dating app

**Visual direction:**
- **Mysterious/exclusive** - Like a members-only club
- **Dark gradients + accent colors** - Almost monochromatic with pops of color
- **Bold typography** - Confident, makes statements
- **Minimal UI chrome** - Lots of negative space, content-focused
- **Punchy animations** - PRs, rank-ups, streaks get visual reactions

**Why this wins:** Young lifters care about aesthetics. If the app looks cool, they'll use it.

## 4. The Social Loop
**What makes us different:** Built for lifters, not general fitness.

- **Full feed with Global + Friends tabs**
- **Workout posts** with stats, captions, optional photos
- **Body model default image** - Muscles colored by volume if no photo uploaded
- **Reactions** - Quick emotes on friends' workouts
- **Public by default** - Discover new people, grow the community
- **Leaderboards** - Per-exercise, overall, volume, user level

**Why this wins:** Lifters want to share with other lifters, not their running friends.

# TARGET USER

## Primary: Young Lifters (18-30)
- **Intermediate experience** (1-3 years lifting)
- **Competitive/social** - Care about comparing with friends
- **Aesthetic-focused** - Care how the app looks
- **Both men AND women** - Tap into current fitness culture trends

## Cultural Positioning
- Tap into current social media trends ("muscle mommies", "tren twins", fitness influencers)
- Stay current but not cringey - a little spice, not over the top
- Expand to appeal to healthy lifestyle/middle-aged audience over time
- Adapt and update as trends evolve

# ANTI-CHEAT PHILOSOPHY

## The Problem
Users can lie about their lifts. This could:
1. Inflate their ranks (making them look stronger than they are)
2. Affect other users' rankings (if ranks were user-data-driven)

## Our Solution

### Static Ranks
- Top-end standards are **fixed** based on verified, video'd world-class lifts
- User-submitted data **cannot inflate** the ranking tiers
- Users always compare against real, trusted standards

### Playful Anomaly Detection
- Flag 10%+ e1RM jumps for users in top 3 ranks
- Cue: "DAAAAMN did you really do that?? That's a HUGE jump!"
- Lower ranks have more tolerance (new users experimenting)
- Cross-exercise validation (overhead press strength predicts lateral raise strength)

### Philosophy
- Users can lie to themselves
- Users cannot lie to affect others
- The system celebrates authenticity through static, verified standards

# RISKS & MITIGATIONS

## Technical Complexity
**Risk:** Building all these features is hard
**Mitigation:** Phase approach, MVP first, iterate

## Design Execution
**Risk:** Getting the "mysterious/exclusive" vibe right is hard
**Mitigation:** Reference Pure dating app, iterate on design, get feedback

## User Acquisition
**Risk:** Building it is easy, getting users is hard
**Mitigation:** Build for shareability, aesthetic that people want to show off, social features that drive invites

## Competition
**Risk:** Liftoff/Hevy/Strong are established
**Mitigation:** Differentiate on personality, aesthetic, and static verified ranks
