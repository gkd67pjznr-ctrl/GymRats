# Forgerank

A competitive lifting app built around **verified strength ranks**,
**per-set PR detection**, and **real-time workout feedback**.

## Core Ideas
- Ranks are fixed to verified top-end lifts (not user-submitted noise)
- Every exercise has equal rank depth
- PRs are detected per-set (weight, reps, e1RM)
- Feedback is fast, encouraging, and non-intrusive

## Status
Early development. Mobile-first. Built with Expo / React Native.

This repo is the source of truth.

## Backend Setup

This app uses Supabase for database and authentication. See [docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md](./docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md) for complete setup instructions.
