Starting Position: Hang with arms fully extended, engaging your core and keeping your shoulder blades pulled down.3. The Pull: Pull your body up towards one hand, similar to a regular pull-up. At the same time, extend the other arm out to the side, keeping it as straight as possible. Your chin should come towards the hand that is pulling.4. Hold &amp; Lower: Briefly hold the top position where one arm is bent and pulling, and the other is extended. Slowly lower yourself back to the starting position with control.5. Alternate: Repeat the movement, pulling up towards the opposite hand.The key to this exercise is to keep the assisting arm as straight as possible to maximise the load on the working arm. This makes it a challenging but effective exercise for unilateral pulling strength."

Now push your hips as high as you can, raising your body off the floor, and continue pushing through your hands, extending your elbows and knees, until your back is fully arched (lumbar bridge). Your head also comes off the floor and should be level with your elbows, looking back. This is the final position. The descent should be slow and controlled. Your spine should be in a convex curve. It's not good to lift your back off the floor; it should remain straight. It should be well rounded. You'll also notice a feeling of increased oxygenation in your back. After lifting off the floor, your hips should be very high, even above the level of your head. Your arms and legs should remain straight. It seems easy, but it requires a good level of flexibility. Breathing should be deep. This posture stretches the rib cage and puts pressure on the diaphragm. If the posture is performed correctly, breathing will be perfect. Never hold your breath during the exercise."

Set up the bands on the sleeves, secured to either band pegs, the rack, or dumbbells so that there is appropriate tension. If dumbbells are used, secure them so that they don't move. Also, ensure that the dumbbells you are using are heavy enough for the bands that you are using. Additional plates can be used to hold the dumbbells down. If more tension is needed, you can either widen the base on the floor or choke the bands. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired.",
      "Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.",
      "With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.",
      "Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe. Use care to return the barbell to the rack."

Keeping your back flat and knees slightly soft, push your hips backward as if trying to close a door behind you until you feel a deep stretch in your hamstrings.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"2\">To finish the rep, explosively drive your hips forward to return to a standing position, squeezing your glutes hard at the top. It is vital to remember that this is <b>not a squat</b>; your knees should not bend deeply, and your arms should remain straight and relaxed, acting only as hooks for the rope. This movement provides constant tension on the glutes while placing less stress on the lower back than a traditional deadlift.</p>"

A good reference is when your elbows touch the tops of your thighs or just inside your knees.<br>Posture: Ensure your back remains flat and your spine neutral throughout the movement.&nbsp;<br><br>Drive: Powerfully drive through your heels to stand up.

Arms are kept straight or slightly bent, and raised through an arc of movement in the coronal plane that terminates when the hands are at approximately shoulder height. Weights are lowered to the starting position, completing one rep. When using a cable machine the individual stands with the coronal plane in line with the pulley, which is at or near the ground.[9] The exercise can be completed one shoulder at a time (with the other hand used to stabilize the body against the weight moved), or with both hands simultaneously if two parallel pulleys are available."

      "Step away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart. Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).",

Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.",
      "Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.",

The decline push-up can be a great way to challenge your upper body strength and improve your ability to perform other push-up variations. As with any exercise, be sure to use proper form and start with a height that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."

This increased range of motion can also help to improve shoulder stability and mobility. Additionally, parallettes push-ups engage the core muscles more than traditional push-ups, as the instability of the parallettes requires greater activation of the core muscles to maintain proper form.",
      "The added challenge of balancing on the parallettes also requires greater upper body strength and control, making parallettes push-ups a more advanced variation of the traditional push-up. They can be a great way to challenge yourself and add variety to your upper body workout routine. As always, be sure to use proper form and start with a level that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."

The lifter may not have as large a range of motion as in a normal shrug done for active flexibility.

Pull your head towards your chest and tilt your pelvis. Now inhale deeply and move into the opposite position, cow pose. Bend your back down, pull your shoulders back slightly and lift your head as far as is comfortable for you. Your gaze is directed upwards. Breathe out consciously and switch back to the cat.

Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).",

Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.",
      "Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the ball of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.",
